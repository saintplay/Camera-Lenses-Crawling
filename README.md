# Lens Crawling

This project compiles into a google chrome extension which can be used to get information about lenses (Aperture, Focal length, available mounts, price, etc).

This is meant to be used with your own lens db table (google sheet, excel or anything in csv format)

# Supported pages

- <https://www.amazon.com/>
- <https://www.bhphotovideo.com/>
- <https://www.fujifilm-x.com/>
- <https://www.meikeglobal.com/>

Adding more pages is very easy, as this project provides an internal api to crawl for elements, and getting lens information has very similar logic across all pages.
