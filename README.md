# Lens Crawling

This project compiles into a google chrome extension which can be used to get information about lenses (Aperture, Focal length, available mounts, price, etc).

This is meant to be used with your own lens db table (google sheet, excel or anything in csv format)

Right now only gattering information from <https://www.bhphotovideo.com/> is supported, but this project is abstracted in a way that multiple pages can be used in the near future.
